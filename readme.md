Very preliminary WinMerge office addin
--------------------------------------

WinMerge assumed to be installed in the default location C:\Program Files\WinMerge\WinMergeU.exe

Saves sheets in temporary files and deletes them when done.  Does not add any temporary sheets to your spreadsheet.

Plan to add options to select WinMerge install location, also where to put temporary files (like maybe C:\Users\You\AppData\Local\Temp)
